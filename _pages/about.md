## About Me

My name is [Torben Dury](https://torbendury.de). I'm interested in tech, whether at work or at home. I'm always open to the new and unknown and love to discover things.

## About The Blog

This blog is backed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) theme. Look how fast it loads, static pages are amazing (and safe to browse)!
