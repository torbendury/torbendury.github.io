Torben Tech Blog is a tidy blog about anything related to interesting technologies. Check out the [search function](/search/) if you are looking for something special, or scroll through the [archive](/archive/) to read my latest posts.

## What you will find here

### Cloud-related posts

Those posts handle everything regarding public and private clouds, including Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Maybe even some Alibaba Cloud! I also do some private cloud development, especially enterprise-grade private clouds like OpenShift.

### Home Tech

Ever wanted to set up your own secure home cloud? Tired of watching advertisements while you're at home or on the road? Find everything you need to know here. On those posts, I mostly focus on **easy** to realize projects which won't burn your purse (cost-effective) and still will work out perfectly while being easy to create & maintain. Everything I write a post about is **battle tested** by myself and many other people. I try to keep everything as understandable as possible while providing rock-solid technology.

### Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are all around us, whether it's your dish washer or (probably) your new light bulb. They all consist of "embedded systems" which mostly include super interesting micro controllers that can be enhanced and developed further. So let's hack into them!

### Anything related to programming

I love looking into the newest trends of programming, and I know you do too. So what's the difference you'll find in my blog posts than what you will find in the 10th million other blog post about it? Well, **I simply do not just advertise every new trend**, but I look under the hood of it, evaluate it and only recommend stuff that I tested myself and that I am happy with. Also, there won't be any burners included. When you enhance your workflow or add some tooling, it should always shrink the time needed to be productive and create something.
